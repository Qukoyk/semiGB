# semiGB

Source code of Probability Discounting Task (PDT) used in my experiment trying to figure out could the existence of minimum reward be the main difference between real-gambling and gambling-like activities(games/gacha, semi-gambling).

## INTRO
Basically same as PDT.    
But even in the lose trials of variable choice in semi-gambling, minimum reward (1 pellet) is existed.
